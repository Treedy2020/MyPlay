The calibration \\nmethods to be used are described in this appendix. \\n 2. CALIBRATION OF THE ENCLOSURE  2.1. Initial Determination of Enclosure Internal Volume \\n \\n2.1.1.  Before its initial use, the internal volume of the chamber sha ll be determined as follows. The \\ninternal dimensions of the chamber are carefully measured, taking into account any \\nirregularities such as bracing struts. The internal volume of the chamber is determined from \\nthese measurements. \\n \\nThe enclosure shall be latched to a fixed volume when the enclosure is held at an ambient temperature of 293K. This nominal volume shall be repeatable wi thin ±0.5% of the reported \\nvalue. \\n 2.1.2.  The net internal volume is determined by subtracting 1.42m\\n3 from the internal volume of the \\nchamber. Alternatively the volume of the test vehicle with the luggage compartment and \\nwindows open or REESS may be used instead of the 1.42m3. \\n \\n2.1.3.  The chamber shall be checked as in Annex 8, Paragraph 2.3. If the hydrogen mass does \\nnot agree with the injected mass  to within ±2% then corrective action is required. \\n \\n2.2. Determination of Chamber Background Emissions \\n \\nThis operation determines that the chamber does not contain any  materials that emit \\nsignificant amounts of hydrogen. The check shall be carried out  at the enclosure's \\nintroduction to service, after any operations in the enclosure which may affect background \\nemissions and at a frequency of at least once per year. \\n \\n2.2.1.  Variable-volume enclosure may be operated in either latched or  unlatched volume \\nconfiguration, as described in Paragraph 2.1.1. above. Ambient temperature shall be \\nmaintained at 293K ± 2K, throughout the four-hour period mentio ned below. \\n 2.2.2.  The enclosure may be sealed and the mixing fan operated for a period of up to 12h before \\nthe four-hour background-sampling period begins. \\n \\n2.2.3.

The chamber is then sealed and the background hydrogen concentration, temperature and \\nbarometric pressure are measured. These are the initial reading s C\\nH2i, Ti and P i used in the \\nenclosure background calculation. \\n \\n2.2.6.  The enclosure is allowed to stand undisturbed with the mixing fan on for a period of four \\nhours. \\n 2.2.7.  At the end of this time the same analyser is used to measure t he hydrogen concentration in \\nthe chamber. The temperature and the barometric pressure are also measured. These are the final readings C\\nH2f, Tf and P f. \\n \\n2.2.8.  The change in mass of hydrogen in the enclosure shall be calcu lated over the time of the \\ntest in accordance with Annex 8, Paragraph 2.4. and shall not exceed 0.5g. \\n \\n2.3. Calibration and Hydrogen Retention Test of the Chamber \\n \\nThe calibration and hydrogen ret ention test in the chamber provides a check on the \\ncalculated volume (Paragraph 2. 1. above) and also measures any leak rate. The enclosure \\nleak rate shall be determined at t he enclosure's introduction t o service, after any operations \\nin the enclosure which may affect the integrity of the enclosure, and at least monthly thereafter. If six consecutive m onthly retention checks are successfully completed without \\ncorrective action, the enclosure leak rate may be determined quarterly thereafter as long as \\nno corrective action is required. \\n 2.3.1. The enclosure shall be purged until a stable hydrogen concentra tion is reached. The mixing \\nfan is turned on, if not already switched on. The hydrogen analyser is zeroed, calibrated if required, and spanned. \\n \\n2.3.2.  The enclosure shall be latched  to the nominal volume position.  \\n \\n2.3.3.  The ambient temperature control system is then turned on (if n ot already on) and adjusted \\nfor an initial temperature of 293K. \\n 2.3.4.  When the enclosure temperatur e stabilizes at 293K ± 2K, the enclosure is sealed and the \\nbackground concentration, temper ature and barometric pressure m easured. These are the \\ninitial readings C\\nH2i, Ti and P i used in the enclosure calibration. \\n \\n2.3.5.  The enclosure shall be unlat ched from the nominal volume. \\n \\n2.3.6.  A quantity of approximately 100g of hydrogen is injected into the enclosure. This mass of \\nhydrogen shall be measured to an accuracy of ±2% of the measure d value. \\n 2.3.7.

These are the final \\nreadings C\\nH2f, Tf and P f for the calibration of the enclosure as well as the initial re adings \\nCH2i, Ti and P i for the retention check. \\n 2.3.8.  On the basis of the readings taken in Paragraphs 2.3.4 and 2.3 .7 above and the formula in \\nParagraph 2.4. below, the mass of hydrogen in the enclosure is calculated.

Test conditions: \\n \\n (a) The test shall be conducted at an ambient temperature of 2 0 ± 10°C; \\n \\n (b) The SOC of REESS shall be adjusted around the middle of no rmal operating range \\nby normal operation recommended by the manufacturer such as dri ving the vehicle or \\nusing an external charger. The accurate adjustment is not requi red as long as the \\nnormal operation of t he REESS is enabled; \\n \\n (c) The overcurrent level (assu ming failure of external DC electricity supply equipment) \\nand maximum voltage (within normal range) that can be applied s hall be determined, \\nif necessary, through consulta tion with the manufacturer. \\n \\n3. The overcurrent test shall be conducted in accordance with Par agraph 4 or Paragraph 5, as \\napplicable and in accordance wit h manufacturer information. \\n \\n4. OVERCURRENT DURING CHARGING BY EXTERNAL ELECTRICITY SUPPLY. \\n \\n This Test procedure is applicable to vehicle-based test for ve hicles that have the capability \\nof charging by DC external  electricity supply: \\n \\n (a) The DC charging vehicle inlet shall be used for connecting the external DC electricity \\nsupply equipment. The charge control communication of the external electricity supply \\nequipment is altered or disabled to allow the overcurrent level  determined through \\nconsultation with the manufacturer; \\n \\n (b) Charging of the REESS by the external DC electricity supply equipment shall be \\ninitiated to achieve the highest normal charge current specifie d by the manufacturer. \\nThe charge current is then increased over 5s from the highest n ormal charge current \\nto the overcurrent level determi ned in accordance with Paragrap h 2.(c) above. \\nCharging is then continued at this overcurrent level; \\n \\n (c) The charging shall be terminated when the functionality of the vehicle's overcurrent \\nprotection terminates the REESS charge current or the temperatu re of the REESS is \\nstabilized such that the temperature varies by a gradient of le ss than 4°C through 2h; \\n \\n (d) Immediately after the termination of charging, one standard cycle as described in \\nAnnex 9, Appendix 1 shall be condu cted, if it is not prohibited  by the vehicle.

This situation sh ould leave the driver and pas sengers with enough time to \\nevacuate. \\n \\n2. INSTALLATIONS \\n 2.1. This test shall be conducted either with the complete REESS or  with REESS subsystem(s). \\nIf the manufacturer chooses to test with REESS subsystem(s), the manufacturer shall \\ndemonstrate that the test result can reasonably represent the p erformance of the complete \\nREESS with respect to its safety performance under the same con ditions. If the electronic \\nmanagement unit for the REESS is not integrated in the casing e nclosing the cells, then the \\nelectronic management unit may be omitted from installation on the Tested-Device if so \\nrequested by the manufacturer.

Test Procedure \\n \\nA vehicle based test or a component based test shall be perform ed at the discretion of the \\nmanufacturer: \\n \\n3.2.1. Vehicle Based Test \\n \\nThe Tested-Device shall be mounted in a testing fixture simulat ing actual mounting \\nconditions as far as possible; no combustible material should b e used for this with the \\nexception of material that is part of the REESS.
