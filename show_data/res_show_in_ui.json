In the PURPOSE section, page_content_1 talks about verifying the performance of the over-discharge protection to prevent severe events from a low SOC. Whereas, page_content_2 mentions that if such functionality is implemented, it should interrupt or limit the discharge current to prevent severe events from a low SOC as specified by the manufacturer.\n3. In INSTALLATIONS section, page_content_1 states the test can be conducted with a complete vehicle or REESS. Ancillary systems that don't influence the test results may be omitted. It also allows for a modified tested device. In page_content_2, the test can be conducted with the complete REESS or related subsystem(s). If testing with subsystem(s), the manufacturer should prove that the test result represents the complete REESS's performance.\n4. In PROCEDURES section, page_content_1 mentions SOC of REESS should be adjusted at a low level, but within normal operating range. For vehicles with onboard energy conversion systems, the electrical energy should be reduced. In page_content_2, it details the steps involving discharging, standard charge, and an observation period which are not present in page_content_1."
